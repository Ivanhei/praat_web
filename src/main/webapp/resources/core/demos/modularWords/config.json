Users can upload their own speech files for segmentation in prosodic phrases and prominence detection or use sample files.\n<br/>A TextGrid with the word segmentation on tier number 1 must be uploaded for this configuration.\n<br/>Users can furthermore select if they want to visualize all tiers generated from each module or only the final prediction (i.e., prosodic phrases and prominence).",
